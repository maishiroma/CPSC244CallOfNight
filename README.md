# Overview
- This game is from the half semester long project that we were tasked to make in CPSC 244 (Level Design I). The game focused on having a humerous story, with fast paced mini games to make up the main gameplay.

# Goal
- The player is tasked to win a certain amount of money in each stage. If they don't meet this requirement, the player must retry the level.

# Features
- Story Mode: Progress through five stages while learning about what led the main character's motives.
- Arcade Mode: Survive as long as you can while paying for rent.
